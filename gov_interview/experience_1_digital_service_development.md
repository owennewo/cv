# Experience 1: Digital Service Development

**Requirement:** Demonstratable experience of digital service development using one or more programming languages, frameworks or application platforms

## Ideas & Options

*List potential experiences/projects that could work for this requirement:*

- DrDoctor Insight Hub.  this was a recent NHS staff facing portal used by 50 NHS Trusts and 1000s of NHS staff.  Lots of different techologies.
- admiral model. deployment etc.  Less tech.
- old projects from akqa

Chosen: Insight Hub
the insight hub was a new area to the DrDoctor staff portal where advanced and AI powered apps were deployed.  This was a full stack + AI solution.  

The purpose of the porpal was to allow staff to understand how patients were using our products and to allow staff to control AI automation or take action suggested by AI eg phone this patient because they may not attend their next appointment

Front end technologies: Vue, PrimeVue, typescript, Rest, GraphQL, Vite, Vitest. 
Backend tech: .NET v8 (C#), Entity Framework, Auth0, Container Apps, Azure SQL server, Function Apps, Complex security (vpns, private endpoints, managed identity). 
Data / ML Technologies: Azure Machine Learning Services, Databricks (Python/PySpark), MLFlow, LightGBM, OpenAI

As team lead I typically like to delegate with other technical members of the team and pair program when team members needed support or that area was losing momentum. There were also aspects that I led such as developing data/devops pipelines and ML models.

As technical lead I selected the technologies, and worked with stakeholders (clients and internal) to define and build out the solution. On a sprintly basis, I was commiting code (C#, python, typescript, html/css) and building the ML models   
I helped develop and support an experimentation culture/process, working with clients to see how new AI techologies can help automate repeatative admin tasks.  This was roled out to other development teams to follow.
Perhaps the most important part of this was the we developed a high functioning team that took pride in what they delivered. It really is a joy to work in a team whose ethos is positive, and collaborative.

## STAR Response

### Situation
NHS trusts needed better visibility into patient engagement with digital services and required AI-powered tools to help staff take proactive action on patient care. DrDoctor identified an opportunity to create a new "Insight Hub" within their existing staff portal to house advanced analytics and AI applications that could transform how NHS staff manage patient interactions.

### Task
As Technical Lead, I was responsible for designing and delivering a full-stack AI solution that would serve 50+ NHS Trusts and thousands of NHS staff. My task included selecting appropriate technologies, building a high-performing development team, working with stakeholders to define requirements, and personally contributing to development across the entire stack while establishing an experimentation culture for AI innovation.

### Action
**Technology Selection & Architecture:** I selected and implemented a modern technology stack including Vue.js with TypeScript for the frontend, .NET 8 with C# for the backend, and Azure cloud services for scalable deployment. I integrated multiple data sources using GraphQL and REST APIs, implemented secure authentication via Auth0, and deployed using Azure Container Apps.

**Hands-on Development:** While leading the team, I maintained active development responsibilities, regularly committing code in C#, Python, TypeScript, and HTML/CSS, SQL and DevOps YAML. I built ML models using Azure Machine Learning Services, Databricks, and integrated OpenAI capabilities for advanced automation features.

**Team Leadership & Collaboration:** I fostered a collaborative development approach through pair programming sessions when team members needed support and delegated effectively to leverage each team member's strengths. I worked closely with both internal stakeholders and NHS clients to ensure the solution met real-world needs.

**Innovation Culture:** I established an experimentation process that allowed us to test how new AI technologies could automate repetitive administrative tasks, which was later rolled out as a framework for other development teams to follow.

### Result
Successfully delivered a comprehensive AI-powered portal serving 50+ NHS Trusts and thousands of NHS staff. An example of an end-to-end solution is prediction patients that are likely to miss their appointment and making an outbound phone call with a next-gen neural voice in order to confirm their appointments.  This type of targetted intervention typically reduces DNA rates by 35% for targetted patients and the automated calls provided scale beyond what is possible by stretched booking teams
